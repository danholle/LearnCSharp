# LearnCSharp

I'm going to do a C# test for a potential employer.

Codility kindly provides some exercises;  so I'm going to implement some of those 
just to get comfortable with the language.

You'll find a bunch of C# projects as sub-directories;  each one being a coding test 
which one is intended to do within a time limit.  They verify correctness, and, in
some cases, seem to verify that you've solved the problem in a way which scales.
